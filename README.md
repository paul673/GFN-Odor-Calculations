# Code for the specialization project

This code has been written for my specialization project. This code is still under development. I experiemented a lot with different approaches. The code and filestructure is therefor quite messy, but will improve in the future. :)

## How to run this code

Create a virtual environment:

```py -3.9 -m venv venv```

Activate the environment 

```.\venv\Scripts\activate```

Check if installing `requirements.txt` works. I have not tested it. 

```pip install requirements.txt```

Try the procedure below if not

Install working version of dgl

```pip install dgl-2.0.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl```

Install openpom

```pip install openpom```
